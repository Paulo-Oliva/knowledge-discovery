# Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining - Project

## Dataset

The dataset is available by clicking [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/339/taxi+service+trajectory+prediction+challenge+ecml+pkdd+2015).
For more information about the dataset, you can visit the [archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20181112235427/http://www.geolink.pt/ecmlpkdd2015-challenge/dataset.html).

P.S. I didn't include the dataset in the repository because it is very large. I recommend you to download it and put all the files in the `data` folder.
You should probably rename the `Porto_taxi_data_test_partial_trajectories.csv` file to `test.csv` and extract the `train.csv` file from the zip file. The other 2 files are sample solutions for the challenge and are not needed for this project.
